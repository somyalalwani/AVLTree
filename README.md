**Problem : AVL Tree
AIM** :To have end to end knowledge of the balanced binary search tree and how it can be used to solve a wide range of problems efficiently. 
**TASK:** Implement AVL Tree with Following Operations.
**Operations to implement:**

```
Operations Complexity
1. Insertion O(log N)
2. Deletion O(log N)
3. Search O(log N)
4. Count occurrences of element O(log N)
5. lower_bound O(log N)
6. upper_bound O(log N)
7. Closest Element to some value O(log N)
8. K-th largest element O(log N)
9. Count the number of elements in the tree whose values fall into a given range. O(log N)
```
**IMPORTANT POINTS:**

1. Implement it with **class** or **struct**. It should be **generic**.
2. **Duplicates** are allowed.
